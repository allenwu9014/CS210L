3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Deque): The key point is doubly-linked list has two pointers to 
   connect other Nodes, the next and prev. The issues are how to fight out the 
   first node and last node to make sure without NullpointerException.

   Problem 2 (Random Queue): Just following the hints in the checklist document.
   The issues for me are how to define the begining of N, and in the dequeue() 
   method how to deal with q[r] to q[N-1]. The first issue maked me loss the 
   firtst number, 1, and the second I have been thought it means remove the 
   value of q[r] and make all q[r] = q [r+1] to shorten the array, which makes 
   the program halted unexpectedly. 
   
    Problem 3 (Subset): if the problem 1 and 2 are correct, the third should be 
    not a problem with the hints in the checklist.

   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I think the difficult part is the debugging of each program. The most 
   frequent bug is NullpointerException, which spend me lots of time looking for
   the worst codes and to consider the logical construction of these codes.
