3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Board Data Type): For myself, the hard part of Board.java is cloneTiles() method. At the first time, I was not aware of the real mean of this method, and not copied a new tiles from this.tiles, which maked 0 covered all the neighbors that it needs to exchange.

   Problem 2 (Solver Data Type): The first difficult part is how to use MinPQ by a different order. After looking for some documents on the Internet, I knew the order should be used after "new", MinPQ<Object>(order). The second is understanding how the game tree work. When I recalled it looks like the method in Ramanujan2, all thing would be clear.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   One thing I learned from the project is I understanded the objects can be inserted to MinPQ are not only number, char, or string, and some objects also could be inserted and sorted.
